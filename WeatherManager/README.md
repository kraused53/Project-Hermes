# Project-Hermes - Weather-Bot
OpenWeather API Manager

**Hermes Sub-System:** Weather-Bot

This subsystem uses the Open Weather Map API to generate Wether forecasts for a given location.
In the future, this subsystem will use a database of user information to automatically generate 
    weather reports for each user. For now, to test the Weather-Bot subsystem, I will using a 
    hard-coded location.
