An Email notification manager

Hermes: [H]elpful [E]mail, [R]eddit, [M]eteorological & [E]ntertainment* [S]ervice

Project Hermes is my first large form project. I aim to create an email notification service that incorporates several smaller, 
practice projects that I have created in the past. 

The main components of Project Hermes:
  * An email manager
    > Drafts and sends emails containing helpful, or fun tidbits of information.
    > This system will also receive and parse email to alter automated email contents and manage users
  * A Reddit Bot
    > This Simple reddit bot will retrieve the top posts from a set of subreddit defined be each user
  * A weather API manager
    > This system will utilize a free license for the "Open Weather Map" API.
    > Each user will be able to set their own location and choose what weather information the want to receive
  * A database manager
    > A simple SQL (?) database to store user settings and email addresses

For the majority of the above systems, I have previously only created very simple test programs. This project aims to combine 
them into useful tool. I will not be hosting this service to the public, and I have no plans to monetize this system.
It is simply an educational endeavor to test my skills and expand my knowledge.
